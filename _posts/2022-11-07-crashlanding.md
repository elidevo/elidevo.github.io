### Crash!

Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After much time wasted I am launching this blog/github to document my skills/online activities and interests.  It took some reading of documentation and getting familiar with Jekyll and Ruby, but hopefully if everything goes right, I will be uploading and updating this blog with things I find fascinating regarding technology.  I will be uploading occasional how-to posts and tutorials/informationals in order to help myself further solidify information that I'm learning.

Thanks for getting this far, but where to next?


Sincerely, <br>
elidevo.
