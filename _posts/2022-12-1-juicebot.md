### Juice!

---

&emsp;This post is to announce that [juicebot](https://github.com/elidevo/project_juicebot) has launched! It is a Discord bot, with currently limited capabilities.  So far, the pigpen cipher and caesar cipher have been implemented. As far as the pigpen functionalities go, juicebot has the ability to encode plaintext into pigpen, and either output it as an image, or a string containing the corresponding discord emojis. \\
&emsp;The plans for this project originally encompassed mostly cryptographic features with some UX overhaul.  At the time of this post being finally committed to github, the project has been put on hold in order to allow for the development of practical skills.  However, juicebot will make a return in the future I'm sure. The next steps? Maybe another day.

Sincerely, \\
elidevo.
